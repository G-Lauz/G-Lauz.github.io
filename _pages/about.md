Guided by passion and a belief that every problem has a solution, I pursue research in collaboration with industry partners to achieve product-driven results. My goal is to seek projects that align with my interests, values and that will allow me to evolve with a team driven by diverse ideas.

**Research:** As part of my master's degree, I specialize in reinforcement learning and generative modeling. I'm particularly interested in the inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the goal is to recover the reward function from expert demonstrations. To this end, I'm working on an algorithm that leverage diffusion models to learn the reward function. The applications of this work are directly relevant to robotics, where defining the reward function is often challenging.
